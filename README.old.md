# Course Porject: CastPress

_CastPress_ is a web app which enables podcast hosts simply build and update their website and where podcast listeners could easily browse and play their favorite episodes.
The app provides a clean backstage interface for podcasters to upload their latest sound files with cover images and customize the appearance of website, supporting multiple authors and adding tags in sound timeline. On the other hand, the audience could browse a minimalist forestage website, which is purely designed for playing podcasts. They are able to use different search filters, including release date, keywords, and tags to reach their desired episodes and share them on social media platforms with attractive web page preview.

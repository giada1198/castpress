        <h2>Problem Description</h2>
        <p>
            Podcast, formed by combining “iPod” and “broadcast”, is an episodic series of audio files which a
            user can
            download to listen on mobile devices. Right now, there are more than 70 thousand active podcast episodes and
            over 29 million episodes, including content in more than 100 languages. 32% of the US population, around 105
            million people, listen to podcasts at least every month.<br>
            If you want to be a podcaster, once you’ve launched your podcast, having a website for your show would be a
            good idea to promote your podcast to the millions of people who might be interested in tuning in. On the
            website, listeners can discover new episodes, learn more about your content, and react to the show. However,
            there isn’t any website configuration and template specifically designed for podcasts. Podcasters only can
            choose WordPress, which is complicated, cumbersome, originally designed for presenting visual content, to
            build their website. Also, purchasing a ready-made theme for podcast might be necessary for most of them who
            don’t have coding experience. Obviously, Podcasters need a platform which is free, simple, lightweight, and
            exclusively designed for podcast, to promote their show.

        <h2>App Description</h2>
        <p>
            <b>CastPress</b>(working title) is a web app which enables podcast hosts simply build and update their website and
            where podcast listeners could easily browse and play their favorite episodes.<br>
            The app provides a clean backstage interface for podcasters to upload their latest sound files with cover
            images and customize the appearance of website, supporting multiple authors and adding tags in sound
            timeline. On the other hand, the audience could browse a minimalist forestage website, which is purely
            designed for playing podcasts. They are able to use different search filters, including release date,
            keywords, and tags to reach their desired episodes and share them on social media platforms with attractive
            web page preview.

				#92 Favor Atender: The Return
			</title>
			<description>
				In the United States, the idea of having a conversation with the President is pretty outlandish. But in Latin America, it’s a regular occurrence. The most accessible president on Latin American social media is Ecuador’s Rafael Correa. But what’s it like to get the attention of a head of state when you may not exactly want it? (NOTE: We first broadcast this story in 2015, but we have since gone back and added a new chapter.)
				This story was originally reported by Silvia Vinas of the radio show Radio Ambulante. Listen to a Spanish language version of the story on their website.

				Alex and PJ chase down the strangest tips from our Weird Ads hotline, and at the bottom of the rabbit hole they find the Mother of All AdWords Scams.
				Futher Reading
				David Segal's story on locksmiths
				
				The Ringfinders website
				
				Form to give feedback on specific ads
				
				Google's statement on our episode:
				Our goal is to provide a great experience for the users, advertisers, and publishers that interact with our advertising products everyday. An important part of this work is listening to reactions—good, bad, and in-between—from our users about their experiences online. We appreciate this very much; it helps us make AdWords better. Bad ads are an industry-wide issue and we fight them with considerable fire-power: we’ve invested in best-in-class technology and built a global team of more than 1,000 googlers specifically dedicated to this effort. While this work has produced positive results—we disabled 780 million ads for violating our policies in 2015 alone—we understand this is an ongoing challenge for everyone and we’ll continue to battle it.

And in the second half of the show - The past month has seen a flood of similar stories at colleges like University of Missouri, Yale, and Georgetown. So we go beyond Colgate and talk to Jamil Smith of the Intersection podcast to try to understand Colgate in the context of these recent events.

				#26 Craigslist, Horsley's List
			</title>
			<description>
				Craigslist is the internet’s classifieds section, but it’s also one of its more shadowy corners, where the ads are anonymous and ephemeral. So we found ourselves wondering - what would we find if we replied to a couple? This week, we track down the people behind two intriguing ads.
				And in the second half of the show - Neal Horsley was an anti-abortion activist who created a website called "The Nuremberg Files," a website that listed the names and addresses of abortion providers around the country. He died last month, but the legacy of his website lives on. We talked to Jennifer Boulanger, a woman who works at a number of abortion clinics, and whose name ended up on Horsley's website in the 90's.
				Reporter Bianca Giaever is a filmmaker and radio producer in New York.

				#25 Favor Atender

			<description>
				In the United States, the idea of having a conversation with the President is pretty outlandish. But in Latin America, it's a regular occurrence. The most accessible president on Latin American social media is Ecuador's Rafael Correa. But what's it like to get the attention of a head of state when you may not exactly want it?

In part II, Sruthi Pinnamaneni tells the story of how the Hasidic community has tried to block off a corner of the internet for itself, and how this new, informal Hasidic internet might offer Shulem a way back.

				#21 Hack The Police
			</title>
			<description>
				When Higinio Ochoa got out of prison for hacking in September of 2014, one of the terms of his parole was that he is not allowed to use any internet connected device. We went to his home in Austin to find out how he got caught and what it's like - in 2015 - to go from living online to not having any internet access.
				Next week we celebrate Email Debt Forgiveness Day! Leave us a voicemail at (917) 475-6668 about your most anxiety inducing unanswered email. All will be forgiven, we promise.

				In 2012, a woman named Lindsey Stone posted a picture she took as a joke to her Facebook page.
